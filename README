RyDyrect is a simple web app I developed out of my own needs. :) 
It is currently is hosted at http://rydyrect.appspot.com/

More description can be found at http://rydyrect.appspot.com/

Most of the directories in this project are required to run the Django ORM on 
Appengine's DataStore, viz.,
    i)   autoload
    ii)  dbindexer
    iii) django
    iv)  djangoappengine
    v)   djangotoolbox

These are required to interface with the DataStore to provide a transparent
ORM, identical to the one we're used to in Django. The collective name is
Django-nonrel (for non-relational).
